I am a 5th year Ph.D. student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Iowa. I am actively looking for Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Computer Vision/Medical Image Analysis/Software Development Engineer internship positions for 2024 Summer.  
 
My research lies in surgical navigation, deep learning, computer vision, medical image processing. My goal is incorporating cutting-edge technologies into surgical navigation systems. In my projects, I applied deep learning to medical image processing, including spine segmentation, fluorescence-to-color image registration. My current project focuses on incorporating 3D surgical tool tracking techinque into our fluorescence imaging surgical navigation system. These projects help me to develop solidate skills on C/C++/Python programming, deep network implementation with Pytorch/Tensorflow, CT/MRI processing, etc.  
 
Also, I have devloped additional skills on C#/Matlab/HTML/JavaScript programming, Unity game development, using 3D Slicer/ImageJ to process medical images, 3D CAD design, 3D printing, etc.
